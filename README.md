# Using association rules to perform a market basket analysis
Imagine you have an online shop and you would like to know which products often bought together. This task is known under the term of market basket analysis, in which retailers seek to understand the purchase behavior of their customers. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling (Wikipedia).

Let us assume we have a data set which contains a list of customers of an online shop and the products they have bought (or viewed) in the past. We will use a rule-based machine learning algorithm called Apriori to perform our market basket analysis. It is intended to identify strong rules/relations discovered in a data set.
